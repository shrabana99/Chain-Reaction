### A chain reaction is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, positive feedback leads to a self-amplifying chain of events.

### It's a multiplayer game consisting of 2 to 4 players. Each player has to create and burst reactive atoms to destory opponent's atoms.
